            </header>
            <p class="grid-item">
               Surrounded by hills, white beaches and on the Costa Blanca, lies sunny Alicante. Thanks to Spain's Mediterranean climate, you can spend most of the year on the white sandy beaches. A day without sand between your toes? How about a city trip to Alicante! In the historic part of El Barrio you walk through the streets with colorful houses. The neighborhood is the starting point to the Castle Santa BÃ¡rbara. High above the city is this gigantic castle that stands on top of the Benacantilberg. The view over the city, the harbor and the Mediterranean Sea is a fantastic memory!
